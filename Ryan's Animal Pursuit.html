			<p>
			It all started when I visited my auntie's house. I came to make a serious business deal. I was trading a bag of Cheddar Chex Mix to my cousin 
			for <em>3 containers</em> of Lay's Stax Potato Crisps. Despite the importance of this deal, my cousin's dog kept charging at us and demanding 
			attention. <br /> <br /> We could only hold out for so long. Eventually, we tabled the trade so we could play with him. After about 
			<time datetime="0h 25m 0s">30 minutes</time> I got tired, so I started to walk back to the house. What I didn't realize was that the dog was
			<em>not</em> ready to go back inside. He kept running around the neighborhood, forcing me to chase after him. When I caught up, I tried picking
			him up and carrying him to the house bodily. That worked until he wriggled free and started running again. I caught up to him and tried to
			tell him that it was time to go. The problem was that he was too excited to talk. Eventually I ended up kneeling down and looking him in the
			eyes to tell him <q>"We need to go back inside!"</q> He paused for a second. I couldn't tell if he got the message, but what I could see was
			that he looked really cool. I never saw him as anything but a playful ball of fur until I got up close. I then saw the same thing in other animals
			I came across. I already enjoyed looking at animals, but only through pictures and videos. I figured other people would enjoy seeing local
			animals too, so I decided to take pictures of some.
			</p>
		<h2 id="Goal">The Goal</h2>
			<p>
			My purpose was to get a <em>nice</em> looking picture of an animal that lived near me. I hoped to accomplish it within a year. The due date was
			not very strict. I had plenty of animals in my neighborhood. I thought the easiest picture to get would, surprisingly, be one of a bird. There
			were at <em>least</em> three species of bird that lived in my neighborhood. I figured I could probably sneak up on one if I was careful. I
			even thought I could somehow coax one to approach me! If I could not get a bird, i still had the squirrels and armadillos to rely on. In a
			desperate situation, I figured I could maybe get a picture of a snake, or a raccoon. In the <strong>worst</strong> case, I
			<em>knew</em> I could get a picture of a lizard, or some insect.
			</p>
		<h2 id="Conflict">The Conflict</h2>
			<p>
			My mission is not as easy as I thought. Three times in the past three days, I had the opportunity to get a picture, and I failed by a wide margin.
			The first attempt was a smll bird, about 18 inches tall. I spotted it eating from my mother's garden, and figured now was my chance to get a
			picture. As I approached the door to go outside, the bird had already noticed me and ran almost 15 feet away. I was a bit disappointed, but I
			did not give up immediately. I slowly approached them, pulling out my phone to take a picture. By time I opened the camera app, the bird had
			flown off. <br /> <br /> The bird attempt was a disappointment, but I saw a squirrel on a nearby tree and decided to try to get a picture of
			them instead. I noticed the squirrel was less squirrelly than the bird. I was approaching them, and they weren't immediately running away! Maybe
			because they were eating at the time. Nevertheless, I already had my camera on, so I started recording as I approached. I almost got a good shot,
			but the squirrel ran away too in the end. <br /> <br /> Just today, I tried to get a picture of a duck, but it was 50 feet into a lake already,
			and my zoom quality was not good enough for an observer to even know that it was a duck if they were watching the video I took. I hoped it would
			swim toward me (for no reason), but it only swam away.
			</p>
		<h2 id="Solution">Possible Solution</h2>
			<p>
			All my attempts have been fails, but I have not run out of options yet! I still have other animals to approach like lizards, armadillos, snakes,
			and raccoons. If they all refuse to participate, I might resort to setting my phone down and hoping an animal approaches it, but also does not
			attack it and does not take it. If <em>that</em> doesn't work, I will turn my focus to insects. I have seen some

			and some <link><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Red_Ants_(1214176165).jpg" title="Red Ant" target="_blank">viscious red ants</a></link>. 
			If all else fails, I will just take some photos of plants.
