	<h2>On the Topic of "Favorites"</h2>
		<p>
		My idea of having <strong>favorites</strong> has shifted after I heard <a href="https://youtu.be/O8asa26_juc?t=2888" target="blank">Link's approach
		to favorites</a>. On the topic of parents having a favorite child, he said, <blockquote>"It jumps around."</blockquote> <em>Before</em>, when I was 
		asked, "What's your favorite?", I thought about which food was currently 1<sup>st</sup> on an established list of foods I liked. <i>Now</i>, I think of
		favorites as whatever I enjoy the most <b>at the moment</b>.
		</p>
		
		<p> That being said, here is my favorite food as of <time datetime="2021-2-26">February 26, 2021</time>.</p>

	I have known about potatoes for most of my life, but <small class="parenthetical">to my shame</small> , I never <em>appreciated</em> them. Whenever I 
	was out eating with friends and someone got a potato product that wasn't french fries, I would just be confused. <em>Why would someone just want to eat a
	potato?</em> I would think. <em>They are too mushy.</em>
	</p>
	
	<p>The problem was, I had never even <em>tried</em> potatoes. All of my bias was based on how they looked. All that changed when I was watching 
	<em>Gourmet Makes</em>, a YouTube series where chef Claire Saffitz makes gourmet versions of commercial foods. In the episode where she made gourmet Tater
	Tots, <a href="https://youtu.be/Xi28pEbMdTw?t=51" target="blank">she mentioned how much she liked potatoes</a>. It didn't happen immediately, but I started
	seeing the goodness of potatoes.
	</p>
	
	<p>One day, I saw some potatoes in the fruit bowl, and I mentioned chef Saffitz' opinion on potatoes to my brother. He decided to rinse one of the 
	potatoes, chop it up, season it, and throw it into an air fryer. After they were done, I was surprised to see they looked and tasted 
	<strong>exactly</strong> like french fries! I had assumed big food companies used secret, patented chemicals to turn potatoes into french fries. As it
	turns out, the potato had the flavor within it the whole time!
	</p>
	
	<p>After that happening, I started thinking of all the potato I was missing out on. Baked potatoes, mashed potatoes, potato salad, tater tots, roasted 
	potatoes, potato skins, sweet potatoes, et cetera.
	</p>

	<p>
	Later, my Mother told me how she prepared potatoes, and she offered to make me a microwaved potato. I was wary because the internet said I had to bake
	potatoes in an <strong>oven</strong> for an hour, but Mom was telling me to microwave it for <em>5 minutes</em>! Nevertheless, I decided to stop running
	from potatoes, and I accepted. It tasted great. The potato was still hot out of the microwave, and the inside was not too mushy. The best part was the 
	skin. The skin carried a lot of that "french fry" flavor that I enjoyed.
	</p>
	
	<p>I will no longer underestimate <em>any</em> food, and I am excited to try every potato dish.</p>
